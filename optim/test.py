To optimize the given code with all necessary safety and error handling improvements, we can use the following approach:

1. **Input Validation**: Ensure that the input is a positive integer greater than 1.
2. **Prime Check**: Implement a more efficient prime checking algorithm by reducing the number of iterations needed.
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases such as negative numbers and zero.

Here's the optimized code:

```python
def check_prime(n):
    """
    Check if a given number is prime.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number to check.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    # A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 1:
        return False
    
    # Check divisibility from 2 to the square root of n
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    
    return True

# Example usage of the function to check prime numbers
print(check_prime(7))  # Output: True
print(check_prime(10))  # Output: False
```

### Key Improvements:

- **Input Validation**: The `isinstance(n, int)` checks if the input is an integer. If not, it returns `False`. It also ensures that the number is greater than 1.

- **Prime Check**: The loop starts from 2 and only goes up to the square root of `n`, which is a more efficient way to check for divisibility compared to checking all numbers up to `n`.

- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Negative numbers are not prime.
  - Zero is not a prime number.

This code will correctly identify and return `True` if a given number is prime, while also handling potential errors such as invalid inputs.
