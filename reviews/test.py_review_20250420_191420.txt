**Review Report for `check_prime` Function**

### **Quality and Robustness Against Boundary Cases or Wrong Inputs of the Code with Explanation**

The provided code function `check_prime(n)` checks if a given number is prime. This function handles basic cases such as numbers less than or equal to 1, which are not considered primes.

However, there are several potential issues in the code that can lead to runtime errors or boundary conditions:

1. **Negative Numbers**: The function does not handle negative numbers gracefully. For example, `check_prime(-2)` would return `False` because there is no number less than 0 that is divisible by -2.

2. **Overflows and Division**: The code attempts to divide the input number by `i` in each iteration of the loop, which can lead to division by zero if `i` is a factor of the number. This could result in an error if the number is prime.

3. **Iterative Check**: The function uses an iterative approach to check divisibility for numbers up to the square root of the number. However, this method has a potential for infinite loops if `n` is large, especially when `i` grows.

4. **Exception Handling**: The function includes exception handling using a try-except block. If an error occurs during the iteration or division, it will be caught and logged.

### **Code Review Report**

**Function `check_prime(n)`**
- **Boundary Cases**: The function handles numbers less than or equal to 1 by returning `False`.
- **Divisibility Check**: It iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `i` is a factor, it returns `False`. This avoids potential division by zero errors and handles negative inputs gracefully.
- **Error Handling**: The function includes exception handling using a try-except block for division by zero.

**Example Usage**
The example usage checks if 7 is prime (True) and 10 is not prime (False).

### **Feedback**

**Q: Can you explain the potential issues with negative numbers?**
**A: Negative numbers are not considered primes because there is no number less than 0 that is divisible by -2.**

**Q: How can I handle negative inputs gracefully in the function?**
**A: The function includes exception handling using a try-except block to catch division by zero errors. This ensures that the program does not crash if an invalid input is provided (e.g., `-2`).

**Q: Can you explain why the code handles large numbers efficiently?**
**A: The function iterates up to the square root of `n`. This avoids infinite loops and can handle large values quickly.**

**Q: How can I improve the function for larger numbers?**
**A: The function should be optimized to handle larger inputs by using a loop that reduces the range of iterations. This will prevent potential stack overflow errors. Additionally, optimizing the loop logic could reduce redundant checks.**
