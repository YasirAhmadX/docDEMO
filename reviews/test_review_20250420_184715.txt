The provided code snippet contains several linting errors, boundary conditions that may cause runtime errors, and establishes necessary try-catch-except blocks to handle errors. Here's a detailed breakdown of the feedback:

### Linting Errors:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `check_prime` is defined with a single parameter `n`, but it contains a missing colon after the function name.
2. **Variable Declaration**: The variable `i` should be declared before its first use in the for loop, and `range` should be used correctly to generate numbers up to the square root of `n`.
3. **Return Type**: The return type of `check_prime` should match the expected result (True or False).
4. **Division by Zero**: There is a division by zero error in the first line of the function, which can lead to runtime errors.
5. **Logical Error**: The condition inside the for loop checks if `n` is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself, but this condition should also be checked for negative numbers.

### Boundary Conditions:
- The number must be greater than 1.
- `range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1)` will generate all integers from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is not a prime number, this range will include `n` itself as well.
- The function should handle negative numbers by returning False or raising an appropriate exception (e.g., ValueError).

### Try-Catch-Except Blocks:
1. **Range Error**: The for loop will raise a `ValueError` if `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`.
2. **Return Type Mismatch**: The function will return `True` even though it finds no divisors other than 1 and itself, but it should return `False` or raise an appropriate exception.
3. **Division by Zero Handling**: If `n` is a prime number, the loop will not execute due to the range being empty.

### Output Feedback:
- **Function Definition**: The code should be self-contained with no syntax errors and should adhere to the recommended style guide (PEP 8).
- **Variable Declaration**: The variable `i` should be declared before its first use in the for loop.
- **Return Type**: The return type of `check_prime` should match the expected result (True or False).
- **Division by Zero**: The condition inside the for loop checks if `n` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, which can lead to runtime errors.
- **Logical Error**: The condition inside the for loop checks if `n` is not a prime number, but this condition should also be checked for negative numbers.

By addressing these issues, the code should work correctly for checking prime numbers and handle potential edge cases gracefully.
